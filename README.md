<h1>Washington D.C. AirBnB Consulting Analysis Project</h1>

  ## Consultant : Steven Broussard

<h2>Description</h2>
Airbnb is a company that provides an online marketplace for short-term rentals of homes and apartments. Much of the data from Airbnb’s website has been compiled and made publicly available on the website Inside Airbnb. For this assignment, you will analyze a sample of the Airbnb listings from some of the neighborhoods in Washington, DC, scraped in July 2023. Each row in this dataset represents a single Airbnb listing. The main goal of the assignment is to use your R, statistics, and data analysis skills in analyzing this dataset. In the real world, you would, of course, have very substantial latitude in how to undertake the analysis and present the results.


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b> Excel </b> 
- <b> R </b>

<h2>Project Considerations & Questions</h2>

- <b> Which combination of neighborhood and room type has the highest average price? Which one has 
the lowest? Which combination has the highest variability? Which combination has the lowest?</b>
- <b> Compute and report a 90% confidence interval for the proportion of superhosts in the population 
using the available sample. Provide an interpretation of the computed confidence interval. </b> 
- <b> Compute and report a 95% confidence interval for the average price of the population using the 
available sample. Provide an interpretation of the computed confidence interval.</b>
- <b> Test whether the average rating of all listings in the population is more than 4 (at 95% level of 
confidence) </b> 
- <b>  What are the top two highly correlated variables with price?</b>
- <b> Visualize price to test for normality (this plot will be counted toward the total number of plots
noted below). </b> 
- <b> Implement two meaningful regression models for the “price” of the listings. Compare/present the 
results of the two models as a table. (Note: The point is not to build the best regression models in 
terms of fit. The point is to simply build and compare two relevant regression models.)</b>

<h2>High-Level Data Conclusions:</h2>

This comprehensive report on Washington DC's Airbnb market, spanning from 2008 to 2023, delves into critical facets influencing rental dynamics. Highlighting extremes, the analysis showcases the priciest listing at Dupont Circle with a tag of $1,228, in stark contrast to the most affordable option at Capitol Hill for a mere $10. The average price across 1,718 listings, at $204.80, provides a benchmark, with price correlations notably tied to accommodation capacity. The report delves further into neighborhood-specific acceptance rates, revealing intriguing patterns. Notably, Foggy Bottom displays preference for non-superhosts, while other neighborhoods lean towards superhosts. The examination of neighborhood and room-type combinations uncovers the highest and lowest average prices, as well as the variations in price within these segments. Statistical inferences elucidate confidence intervals for superhosts and average prices, while a t-test validates that average ratings exceed 4. The analysis culminates in regression models, affirming the robustness of the Price_Accommodates model, offering a valuable 34.48% variance explanation in price. Additionally, visualizations and diagnostics provide a holistic understanding of price distributions and model performance. This exhaustive exploration serves as an invaluable guide for stakeholders navigating the dynamic landscape of Washington DC's Airbnb market.
